# ix

Ix is the project to end all projects. It's the place that should always be home.
Notes, plans, data, prototypes. This should all live in this one place.

## What is Ix?
Ix is a planet in the Dune universe. If you have not read Dune. Please go read it now.
It is the place where all the science and technology happens. It is the place I would want to be.

At this point I should just write. I can edit and move things around when I actually have contenten to move around.
I want to be able to make a flashcard game.
Lot's of cli tools would be fun to make.
Document the learning of Clojure.

I need to come up with some goals for what this *app* should do.

At some point decide if you are going to use org mode for your documentation.
Make an output folder and a set of utility methods that make it easy to write to a file and read from a file.

After you are done with writing a line press esc.
This will get you in the habit of using the vim style navigation that you want to learn so much.

Write guides on how todo little things in your editor. This is going to be the practice you need to keep going.
This is going to be the movement you want to see. It will keep you interested in the work that you are doing.
It's the secret sausce[^1] that will make you a better programmer and worker.

> Don't be afraid to refactor.

Refactoring is not the enemy. It's actually your best friend. It is what let's you learn. It's the way you get better.


You are going to need to setup your workspace.
